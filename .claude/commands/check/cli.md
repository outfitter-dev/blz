# Check: blz CLI tool with subagent

Instructions: $ARGUMENTS
- Invoke the `@agent-blz-tester` subagent to perform a comprehensive check of the `blz` CLI tool
- If you want to focus on a specific aspect of `blz`, be sure to specify that in your instructions to them.
- Otherwise, have them perform a full check of `blz` and provide a detailed report.

Steps after the check:
1. Independently verify the results by running another `@agent-blz-tester` subagent with specific guidance based on the initial check.
2. Report the findings to the user and provide a summary of the results.
3. Follow up and ask if the user would like to proceed with any changes or improvements (as a numbered list), and offer to create GitHub issues for each aspect.
