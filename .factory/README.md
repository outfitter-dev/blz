- Search and link related issues

**Usage Examples:**
- `/linear-issue create` - Create new issue with templates
- `/linear-issue update BLZ-123` - Update existing issue
- `/linear-issue link BLZ-456` - Generate git/PR templates
- `/linear-issue search performance` - Find related issues

## MCP Integration Overview

The blz project includes enhanced MCP support for Factory integration:

### Linear MCP Server
- **Access Linear issues** directly from Factory sessions
- **Create and update tasks** following blz project conventions
- **Generate proper git workflows** with Linear ID integration
- **Search project history** and find related work

### Configuration Files

**`.mcp.json`** - MCP server configuration for Factory:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "linear": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-linear@latest"],
      "env": {
        "LINEAR_API_KEY": ""
      }
    },
    "blz-docs": {
      "command": "blz",
      "args": ["mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "BLZ_MCP_SOURCES": "rust,typescript,react,node,python",
        "BLZ_MCP_MAX_RESULTS": "50"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Quick MCP Setup

1. **Get Linear API Key**: Visit [Linear Settings](https://linear.app/settings/api)
2. **Set Environment**: `export LINEAR_API_KEY="lin_api_..."`
3. **Add to Factory**: `/mcp add linear "npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-linear@latest" -e LINEAR_API_KEY=your_key`
4. **Test Setup**: `/mcp-test linear`

See [MCP_SETUP.md](./MCP_SETUP.md) for detailed configuration instructions.

## Linear Workflow Integration

### Branch Naming Convention
```bash
# Format: blz-123-feature-description
git checkout -b blz-123-add-search-pagination
```

### Commit Message Format
```bash
git commit -m "feat: add search pagination

Implements pagination for search results with configurable page size.

Fixes: BLZ-123"
```

### PR Title Format
```bash
# Format: type: description [BLZ-123]
feat: add search pagination [BLZ-123]
```

## Usage Notes

1. **Command Discovery**: Use `/commands` in Factory to see all available commands
2. **Reloading**: Press `R` in the commands UI to reload after making changes
3. **Arguments**: Commands support flexible argument handling with `$ARGUMENTS`
4. **Project Context**: All commands are designed specifically for blz development workflows
5. **MCP Integration**: Enhanced commands work with Linear MCP server when configured

## Command Development

These commands follow Factory's custom command conventions:

- **Markdown files** (`.md`) become prompt templates with YAML frontmatter
- **Executable files** with shebangs run as scripts and return output to chat
- **Filenames** are automatically slugified (spaces â†’ dashes, lowercase)
- **Arguments** are passed via `$ARGUMENTS` (Markdown) or `$1, $2, etc.` (executables)

## Migration from Claude

These commands replace and improve upon the previous `.claude/commands/check/cli.md` implementation:

- **Enhanced Structure**: More comprehensive test plans and review criteria
- **Factory Syntax**: Proper YAML frontmatter and argument handling
- **Improved UX**: Better descriptions, hints, and flexible argument support
- **Automation**: Added executable scripts for quick validation
- **MCP Integration**: Linear workflow integration with Factory's MCP support
- **Documentation**: Clear usage examples and development guidance

## Contributing

When adding new Factory commands:

1. Follow the established naming and structure patterns
2. Include proper YAML frontmatter with description and argument hints
3. Test both standalone and integrated Factory usage
4. Update this README with command documentation
5. Consider MCP integration opportunities

For MCP-specific contributions:
1. Follow Linear conventions in `.agents/rules/LINEAR.md`
2. Test with various Linear workspace configurations
3. Ensure environment variable handling is secure
4. Document troubleshooting steps

See [Factory's custom commands documentation](https://docs.factory.ai/cli/configuration/custom-commands) for more details.
