# Workflow Testing Guide

Use [act](https://github.com/nektos/act) to rehearse the release automation locally before pushing tags.

## Prerequisites
- Docker installed and running
- `act` installed (`brew install act` or see the act README)
- A personal access token with `repo` scope saved as `~/.config/act/secrets` or passed via `-s GITHUB_TOKEN=...`

## Quickstart
```bash
# Dry-run the release detection logic on the current branch
act pull_request -W .github/workflows/auto-release.yml -j detect

# Simulate the publish pipeline (builds only, publishing steps skip when ACT=true)
ACT=1 act workflow_dispatch \
  -W .github/workflows/publish.yml \
  -j upload_release_assets \
  --input tag=v0.0.0 --input dist_tag=latest
```

## Notes
- Only trigger the build-focused jobs (e.g., `upload_release_assets`) when rehearsing locally so no external publishing runs.
- You can mount a cache volume to reuse compilation artifacts:
  `act workflow_dispatch --reuse -v cargo-cache:/github/home/.cargo`
- Publishing jobs still require network access and real secretsâ€”omit them while testing.

Refer back to this document whenever you need to validate changes to the release automation without burning real tags.
