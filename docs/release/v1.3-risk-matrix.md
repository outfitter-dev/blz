# BLZ MCP Server v1.3 Risk Matrix

## Overview

This document tracks all identified risks for the v1.3 release, their mitigation status, and ownership.

**Last Updated**: 2025-10-16
**Target Release**: v1.3.0
**Next Review**: 2 weeks post-release

## Risk Categories

### 1. Performance Risks

| Risk | Severity | Status | Mitigation | Owner | Follow-up |
|------|----------|--------|------------|-------|-----------|
| Search latency degradation with large indices | Medium | ✅ Mitigated | Benchmark suite validates P95 < 50ms against 43k-line Bun docs; Tantivy provides sublinear scaling | Core Team | Monitor production metrics |
| Index build time scaling | Low | ✅ Mitigated | < 150ms/MB validated; incremental updates reduce rebuild frequency | Core Team | None planned |
| Memory growth with large indices | Medium | ⚠️ Monitored | Tantivy's memory-mapped indices provide bounded memory usage; RwLock prevents concurrent index duplication | Core Team | Create issue if >200 MB reported |
| Cold cache startup latency | Low | ✅ Mitigated | First index load < 150ms; subsequent searches benefit from warm cache | Core Team | None |
| Concurrent request contention | Low | ✅ Mitigated | RwLock allows multiple concurrent readers; write lock only during source-add | Core Team | None |

**Notes**:
- Bun documentation (43,150 lines) used as benchmark representative of large documentation sets
- P50 < 10ms, P95 < 50ms validated across 50+ benchmark runs
- Memory profiling shows stable memory usage under sustained load

### 2. Security Risks

| Risk | Severity | Status | Mitigation | Owner | Follow-up |
|------|----------|--------|------------|-------|-----------|
| SSRF via source-add | Medium | 🔴 Known Issue | URL scheme validation (http/https only); documented limitation; single-user deployment model limits exposure | Security Team | BLZ-219: Add internal IP blocklist (v1.3.1, 2-week target) |
| Path traversal via alias | Low | ✅ Mitigated | Alias validation (alphanumeric + hyphens/underscores, must start with letter); Storage API prevents directory escapes | Core Team | None |
| Command injection via run-command | Low | ✅ Mitigated | Static whitelist enforcement; no shell execution; commands implemented as direct Rust functions | Core Team | None |
| Information leakage via diagnostic output | Low | ✅ Mitigated | Path sanitization replaces home directory and storage root in all output | Core Team | None |
| XSS via search results | Very Low | ✅ Not Applicable | JSON API with no HTML rendering; client responsible for display sanitization | N/A | None |
| Malicious llms.txt content | Low | ⚠️ Monitored | Tantivy query parser prevents injection; tree-sitter handles malformed markdown safely | Core Team | None |

**Notes**:
- SSRF issue documented in security review; acceptable for single-user local deployment
- 51 security-focused unit tests validate input validation and whitelist enforcement
- No unsafe code blocks in entire MCP crate

**SSRF Details**:
- **Attack Vector**: User provides URL to internal service (e.g., http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/)
- **Current Mitigation**: Scheme validation only (http/https)
- **Planned Fix**: IP address blocklist for 127.0.0.0/8, 169.254.0.0/16, 10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, 192.168.0.0/16, ::1, fc00::/7
- **Business Context**: Low priority due to single-user CLI deployment model; no server-side exposure

### 3. Operational Risks

| Risk | Severity | Status | Mitigation | Owner | Follow-up |
|------|----------|--------|------------|-------|-----------|
| Handshake size growth with new tools | Low | ✅ Mitigated | learn_blz.json bounded < 1 KB; schemas use minimal descriptions; pagination available for future expansion | Core Team | Review at each tool addition |
| Cache invalidation bugs | Medium | ⚠️ Monitored | Manual testing complete; RwLock ensures atomic cache updates; source metadata tracks versions | QA Team | Monitor user reports |
| MCP protocol spec changes | Medium | ⚠️ Monitored | Using stable MCP v1.0 protocol; rmcp library abstracts protocol details | Core Team | Subscribe to MCP spec updates |
| Index corruption | Low | ✅ Mitigated | Tantivy provides ACID guarantees; validate command checks integrity; automatic rebuild on corruption | Core Team | None |
| Disk space exhaustion | Low | ⚠️ Documented | Index size ~10% of raw content; no automatic cleanup (user responsibility) | Ops Team | Consider quota enforcement in v1.4.0 |

**Notes**:
- Handshake measured at ~850 bytes (well under 1 KB limit)
- Cache invalidation tested with concurrent source-add and search operations
- MCP spec tracking: https://spec.modelcontextprotocol.io/

### 4. Integration Risks

| Risk | Severity | Status | Mitigation | Owner | Follow-up |
|------|----------|--------|------------|-------|-----------|
| Claude Code compatibility | Low | ✅ Validated | Tested with Claude Code 0.9.2+; stdio transport works correctly; schemas validated | Integration Team | None |
| Cursor compatibility | Low | ✅ Validated | Tested with Cursor 0.42+; configuration documented | Integration Team | None |
| Generic MCP client issues | Medium | ⚠️ Documented | Fallback resource:// URIs for clients rejecting blz:// scheme; comprehensive error messages | Support Team | Document as clients emerge |
| stdio transport reliability | Low | ✅ Mitigated | Robust JSON-RPC framing; graceful shutdown handling; connection error logging | Core Team | None |
| Tool schema validation failures | Low | ✅ Mitigated | All schemas validated with serde_json; comprehensive parameter validation | Core Team | None |

**Notes**:
- Tested with Claude Code (primary target) and Cursor (secondary target)
- Generic MCP clients should work but require individual validation
- Fallback URIs ensure maximum client compatibility

### 5. Documentation Risks

| Risk | Severity | Status | Mitigation | Owner | Follow-up |
|------|----------|--------|------------|-------|-----------|
| Incomplete tool examples | Low | ✅ Mitigated | All 5 tools documented with multiple examples in TOOLS.md; common patterns section included | Docs Team | None |
| Outdated setup instructions | Low | ✅ Mitigated | Setup tested against Claude Code 0.9.2+ and Cursor 0.42+; screenshots current | Docs Team | Review quarterly |
| Missing troubleshooting guide | Medium | ⚠️ In Progress | Common issues documented in SETUP.md; expanded troubleshooting section planned | Docs Team | Add FAQ section post-release |
| Security documentation gaps | Low | ✅ Mitigated | Comprehensive security review completed; threat model documented; limitations clearly stated | Security Team | None |

**Notes**:
- Documentation tested with fresh users (internal validation)
- All CLI equivalents documented for each MCP tool
- Security limitations prominently disclosed

## Appendix: Risk Assessment Methodology

### Likelihood Scale

- **Very Low**: < 5% probability in normal operation
- **Low**: 5-20% probability in normal operation
- **Medium**: 20-50% probability in normal operation
- **High**: 50-80% probability in normal operation
- **Very High**: > 80% probability in normal operation

### Impact Scale

- **Low**: Minor inconvenience, workaround available
- **Medium**: Degraded functionality, user visible impact
- **High**: Feature unavailable, significant user impact
- **Critical**: Data loss, security breach, system unavailable

### Overall Risk Calculation

Overall Risk = Likelihood × Impact

Example:
- SSRF: Medium likelihood (20-50%) × Medium impact (degraded security posture) = Medium overall risk
- Path traversal: Very Low likelihood (< 5%) × High impact (filesystem access) = Low overall risk (mitigated)
