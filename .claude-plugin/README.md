# BLZ Claude Plugin

This directory contains the plugin manifest used by Claude Code.

Plugin content now lives in `packages/agents/` (commands, agents, skills). See `packages/agents/README.md` for usage details.

For local development installs, run `blz plugin install` from the repo root (or `./scripts/install-claude-plugin-local.sh` for manual setup).
