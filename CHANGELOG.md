## [0.5.0] - 2025-10-02

### Breaking Changes
- Removed backwards compatibility for v0.4.x cache format. Users upgrading from v0.4.x will need to clear their cache with `blz clear --force` and re-add sources. The CLI will detect old cache format and display helpful error message with migration instructions.

### Added
- New `blz clear` command to remove all cached sources and indices.
  - `--force` flag to skip confirmation prompt for non-interactive use.
  - Helpful error detection when old v0.4.x cache format is found.

- Automatic preference for llms-full.txt when available via `FORCE_PREFER_FULL` feature flag (#234).
- Comprehensive test suite for automatic llms-full preference behavior (5 new tests) (#234).
- CLI refactoring with testable seams for `clear`, `list`, `remove`, and `update` commands.

### Changed
- **XDG-compliant paths**: Both config and data now respect XDG Base Directory specification:
  - Config: `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/blz/` (if set) or `~/.blz/` (fallback)
  - Data: `$XDG_DATA_HOME/blz/` (if set) or `~/.blz/` (fallback)
  - Environment overrides: `BLZ_GLOBAL_CONFIG_DIR` and `BLZ_DATA_DIR`
- **Reorganized data directory**: Source directories now organized under `sources/` subdirectory for cleaner structure.
- **Renamed state file**: `blz.json` renamed to `data.json` to distinguish runtime state from configuration files.
- Simplified flavor selection to automatically prefer llms-full.txt without user configuration (#234).
- Hidden `--flavor` flags across add, search, and update commands for cleaner user experience (#234).
- Updated `--yes` flag help text to be flavor-agnostic: "Skip confirmation prompts (non-interactive mode)" (#234).
- Removed `BLZ_PREFER_LLMS_FULL` environment variable (automatic preference replaces manual configuration) (#234).
- Removed custom LlmsJson deserializer for v0.4.x format (141 lines removed).

### Fixed
- Restored metadata alias propagation for update and add flows.
- Addressed security and portability issues identified in code review.
- Normalized heading counts with accurate recursive counting.
- Parser now filters out placeholder "404" pages.

### Documentation
- Updated 11 documentation files to reflect flavor simplification and automatic llms-full preference (#234).

## [0.4.1] - 2025-09-29

### Added
- Search CLI pagination with history-aware `--next`/`--last`, improved JSON metadata, and stricter batch `get` span handling (#229).

### Changed
- JSON output now always includes both rounded `score` and `scorePercentage`, plus compatibility fields mirrored for downstream tooling (#229).
- Pagination flow now treats `--limit` as optional, enforces consistent page size when continuing with `--next`, and surfaces friendlier tips for text output (#229).
- Release automation can be manually dispatched without a full publish run (#228).

### Fixed
- Search history writes use fsync + atomic rename with advisory locking to avoid corruption when multiple CLI processes exit simultaneously (#229).

## [0.4.0] - 2025-09-26

### Changed
- Unified flavor resolution across `list`, `search`, and `get` so CLI commands respect stored preferences consistently (#227).

### Changed
- Automated releases via label-driven workflows that build cross-platform artifacts, upload them, and publish npm/crates/Homebrew in sequence.
- Added asset readiness guards for the Homebrew job and tightened release undraft conditions to avoid incomplete releases.
- Cached `cargo-edit` in CI and documented local `act` rehearsals for release workflows.

### Fixed
- Windows npm postinstall now imports `package.json` via URL (no `ERR_UNSUPPORTED_ESM_URL_SCHEME`) and the package requires Node â¥ 18.20.0.
