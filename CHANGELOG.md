## [0.2.1] - 2025-09-17

### Changed
- Automated releases via label-driven workflows that build cross-platform artifacts, upload them, and publish npm/crates/Homebrew in sequence.
- Added asset readiness guards for the Homebrew job and tightened release undraft conditions to avoid incomplete releases.
- Cached `cargo-edit` in CI and documented local `act` rehearsals for release workflows.

### Fixed
- Windows npm postinstall now imports `package.json` via URL (no `ERR_UNSUPPORTED_ESM_URL_SCHEME`) and the package requires Node â‰¥ 18.20.0.

## [0.2.0] - 2025-09-15

### Added
- **`blz diff` command**: Compare current and archived versions of sources to see what's changed
- **`blz alias` command**: Manage source aliases with `add` and `rm` subcommands for better organization
- **`blz docs` command**: Generate CLI documentation in markdown or JSON format
- **Targeted cache invalidation**: Optimized search cache that invalidates only affected aliases on updates
- **Anchors support**: Parse and index anchor links from llms.txt files for better navigation
- **HEAD preflight checks**: Verify remote availability and size before downloads with retry logic
- **Windowed segmentation fallback**: Handle large documents that exceed indexing limits gracefully
- **Dynamic shell completions**: Enhanced completion support with metadata-aware suggestions
- **Flavor policy for updates**: Control update behavior with `--flavor` (auto, full, txt, current)

### Changed
- **JSON output improvements**: Consistent camelCase field names, added sourceUrl and checksum fields
- **CLI improvements**: Added `-s` as short alias for `--source`, improved error messages
- **Documentation restructure**: Split CLI docs into organized sections under `docs/cli/`
- **Performance**: Optimized search with granular cache invalidation per alias

### Fixed
- **JSON stability**: Proper stderr/stdout separation for clean JSON output
- **Panic handling**: Graceful handling of broken pipe errors (SIGPIPE)
- **Large document handling**: Fallback to windowed segmentation for documents exceeding limits

### Developer Experience
- **`blz instruct` command**: Append live CLI documentation to agent instructions
- **Improved logging**: All logs go to stderr, keeping stdout clean for JSON/NDJSON output
- **Better error messages**: More actionable error messages with suggestions
