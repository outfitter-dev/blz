# GitHub Actions Multilingual Analysis - Complete Report

## Overview

This analysis examines action verbs, configuration-related terms, and technical phrases across 12 languages found in Anthropic's GitHub Actions documentation. The research was conducted using the `blz` CLI to search the Anthropic documentation source locally.

## Deliverables

### 1. Executive Summary
**File**: FINDINGS_SUMMARY.md

Key highlights:
- 12 languages identified (English, Mandarin, Traditional Chinese, Japanese, Russian, German, Spanish, French, Indonesian, Portuguese, Italian, Korean)
- 7 core action verbs found universally across all languages
- Language-specific formation patterns analyzed by linguistic family
- 80+ search results analyzed
- Recommendations for multilingual development

### 2. Action Verbs Translation Matrix
**File**: action_verbs_matrix.md

Comprehensive translation tables:
- Core Configuration Verbs (setup, install, configure, add, execute, copy, open)
- Code Manipulation Verbs (analyze, create, implement, fix, follow)
- Configuration Nouns (repository, secret, API key, permissions, workflow)
- Frequently Paired Phrases (quick setup, manual setup, read/write permissions)
- Language Group Patterns (Tier 1/2/3 classification)

### 3. Detailed Analysis Report
**File**: github_actions_analysis.md

In-depth breakdown:
- Action verbs by language (full translations with phonetic guides)
- Configuration-related terms and their language variants
- Common technical phrases across languages
- Language-specific patterns by linguistic family
- Configuration action verb frequency (Tier 1, 2, 3)
- Localization patterns (literal, adapted, native terminology)
- Actionable insights for developers

### 4. Verbatim Documentation Excerpts
**File**: VERBATIM_EXCERPTS.md

Complete parallel documentation sections in all 12 languages:
- English baseline
- All 11 language variants with identical structure
- Setup sections with Quick Setup and Manual Setup pathways
- Permission requirements
- Configuration steps

## Key Findings

### Universal Tier 1 Verbs (100% Coverage)
1. Setup / Configure
2. Install
3. Configure
4. Add / Create
5. Execute / Run
6. Copy
7. Open

### Structural Consistency
- All languages maintain identical workflow: Quick Setup → Manual Setup
- Permission taxonomy (Contents, Issues, Pull Requests) is invariant
- Commands (`/install-github-app`) remain unchanged across all 12 languages
- All languages use native verbs while preserving structure

### Language Family Patterns
- **Germanic** (English, German): Base verb + suffixes
- **Romance** (Spanish, French, Italian, Portuguese): Latin-based conjugation
- **Sino-Tibetan** (Mandarin, Traditional Chinese): Compound morphemes, no conjugation
- **Japanese**: Mix of kanji and katakana loanwords
- **Slavic** (Russian): Perfective/imperfective verb aspect system
- **Austronesian** (Indonesian): Affixation patterns
- **Koreanic** (Korean): Agglutinative morphology with particle markers

### Localization Insights
1. **Repository**: Each language creates its own term (native preference)
2. **GitHub App**: Mostly preserved/adapted (product-specific term)
3. **API Key**: English preserved with language-specific word for "key"
4. **Setup Pathway**: Identical structure but native verb forms
5. **Workflow**: Often borrowed/adapted from English but contextualized

## Search Methodology

- **Tool**: blz CLI (local search cache for llms.txt)
- **Source**: Anthropic documentation (docs.anthropic.com/llms-full.txt)
- **Search Terms**: "GitHub Actions" and "GitHub Action"
- **Total Results**: 80+ unique search results
- **Context Retrieved**: Full setup sections with surrounding context
- **Languages Identified**: 12 complete language variants

## Research Results Distribution

- English: 20% (baseline)
- Mandarin Chinese: 15%
- Traditional Chinese (Taiwan): 15%
- Japanese: 10%
- Russian: 10%
- German: 10%
- Spanish: 5%
- French: 5%
- Indonesian: 3%
- Portuguese (Brazilian): 3%
- Italian: 3%
- Korean: 3%

## Recommendations Summary

### For Multilingual Development

1. **Verb Translation**: Translate core verbs into native forms (don't preserve English)
2. **Noun Strategy**: Allow native terminology development (repository → 仓库 → repositorio)
3. **Structure**: Maintain identical workflow across all languages
4. **Testing**: Verify Tier-1 verbs, permission terminology, setup pathway mirroring
5. **Documentation**: Use template-based generation with placeholder verbs

### Best Practice
Localize verbs aggressively, preserve structure rigidly, standardize technical concepts, and test for parallel navigation across all language variants.

## About This Analysis

This multilingual analysis was conducted to identify consistent patterns in how technical action verbs and configuration terminology translate across linguistic families. The research focuses on the "GitHub Actions" concept from Anthropic's documentation, examining how this integrations are explained to users in 12 different languages.

The goal is to provide actionable insights for developers and localization teams working on multilingual technical documentation, with emphasis on maintaining consistency while respecting linguistic traditions and patterns.
