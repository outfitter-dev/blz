# [CHECKPOINT] Pagination divide-by-zero fix

## Summary
Fixed critical panic in search pagination when limit is 0, added comprehensive tests, and improved error handling across the search module.

## Tasks

### Done

- [x] Fix divide-by-zero panic in pagination logic
  - CLOSES: #42 / BLZ-18
  - Added guard clause to return early when limit is 0
  - Implemented saturating arithmetic for page calculations
- [x] Add comprehensive test coverage
  - [x] Unit tests for edge cases (0 limit, overflow)
  - [x] Property-based tests with proptest
- [x] Update error messages for clarity

### In Progress

- [ ] Improve search performance for large result sets
  - ADDRESSES: #43 / BLZ-19
  - Implemented parallel search (needs benchmarking)
  - Memory usage optimization pending

### Not Started

- [ ] Add pagination to CLI output
  - RELATED: #44 / BLZ-20
- [ ] Implement cursor-based pagination for API
  - RELATED: #45 / BLZ-21

## Changes

- `crates/blz-core/src/search.rs`: Fixed pagination logic with zero-check
- `crates/blz-core/src/search/tests.rs`: Added edge case tests
- `crates/blz-core/tests/integration/pagination.rs`: New integration tests
- `crates/blz-core/Cargo.toml`: Added proptest dev dependency

## Decisions & Rationale

- **Saturating arithmetic over checked**: Avoids Option returns in hot path, aligns with existing codebase patterns
- **Early return for zero limit**: Cleaner than wrapping entire function in conditional
- **Property testing with proptest**: Catches edge cases traditional tests might miss

## Current State

- **Branch Status**: 3 commits ahead of main, ready for review
- **CI Status**: All checks passing (clippy, tests, coverage)
- **PR Stack**: Rebased on latest main after #47 merged
- **Open Items**: CodeRabbit review comments need addressing

## Blockers

- Waiting on benchmark infrastructure (Issue #28) to validate performance claims

## Next Steps

- Address PR review feedback
  - Specifically the suggestion about using `NonZeroU32` for limit
- Benchmark parallel search implementation once #28 lands
  - Target: <10ms for 1000 results

## Follow-ups

- Consider adding telemetry for pagination usage patterns
- Document pagination behavior in API docs
- Add pagination examples to CLI help text

## Context/Notes

The divide-by-zero was only triggered in production when users passed `--limit 0` thinking it would return all results. We should consider making 0 mean "unlimited" in a future PR.
