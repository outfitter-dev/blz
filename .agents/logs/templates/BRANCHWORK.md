## CI Status

| Tests | ‚úÖ Pass | 127/127 passing |

| Benchmarks | ‚è≥ Running | ~3.5x improvement |

## Decisions

- **Use tokio channels initially**: Simpler integration with existing async code, can optimize later
- **Fixed worker pool size**: Dynamic scaling added complexity without clear benefit
- **Memory limit as hard cap**: Better to fail fast than degrade performance
- **Batch size of 100**: Sweet spot between memory usage and throughput based on benchmarks

## Notes

- Memory limit feature works well but might need tuning for very small documents
- Consider making worker thread count auto-detect based on CPU cores
- crossbeam_channel migration was straightforward, good suggestion from review
- Circuit breaker pattern deferred to follow-up PR (BLZ-44)

## Updates

### 2025-08-29 18:55: [@claude] Initial implementation

Created parallel indexer module in `src/indexer/parallel.rs`

- Added worker pool configuration to `Config` struct
- Implemented `BatchProcessor` with configurable concurrency
- Files changed:
  - `src/indexer/parallel.rs` - New parallel processing module
  - `src/config.rs` - Added worker_threads and batch_size options
  - `src/indexer/mod.rs` - Integrated parallel indexer

### 2025-08-29 20:30: [@claude] Added tests and benchmarks

Comprehensive test coverage for concurrent operations

- Benchmark showing 3.5x speedup on 8-core machine
- Files changed:
  - `tests/parallel_indexing.rs` - Integration tests
  - `benches/indexing.rs` - Performance benchmarks

### 2025-08-29 21:15: [@coderabbitai] PR Review

````markdown
**Overall Assessment**: Good implementation of parallel indexing with proper error handling. A few suggestions for improvement:

1. **üî¥ Critical**: Potential deadlock in `BatchProcessor::flush()`
   - File: `src/indexer/parallel.rs`, Line 145
   - The mutex lock order could cause deadlock under high concurrency
   ```rust
   // Current (problematic):
   let queue = self.queue.lock().await;
   let workers = self.workers.lock().await;

   // Suggested fix:
   let workers = self.workers.lock().await;
   let queue = self.queue.lock().await;
   ```

2. **üü° Performance**: Consider using `crossbeam_channel` instead of `tokio::sync::mpsc`
   - File: `src/indexer/parallel.rs`, Line 78
   - Crossbeam channels have better performance for this use case
   - Benchmark results show 15% improvement in throughput

3. **üü¢ Suggestion**: Add metrics collection
   - Would be helpful to track indexing rate, queue depth, and worker utilization
   - Consider integrating with existing metrics system

**Status**: Changes requested

### 2025-08-30 09:00: [@galligan] PR Review

````markdown
LGTM with one question:

- How does this handle memory pressure when indexing very large documents?
- Should we add a memory limit configuration option?
````

### 2025-08-30 09:30: [@claude] Response to review

Explained current backpressure mechanism, agreed to add memory limits in follow-up PR

### 2025-08-30 10:45: [@claude] Addressed critical review feedback

Fixed deadlock issue in mutex ordering

- Added memory_limit_mb to Config
- Implemented memory tracking in BatchProcessor
- Files changed:
  - `src/indexer/parallel.rs` - Fixed mutex ordering, added memory tracking
  - `src/config.rs` - Added memory_limit_mb option

### 2025-08-30 14:22: PR Review Update from @coderabbitai

````markdown
Re-reviewed after commits abc123, def456:

‚úÖ Deadlock issue fixed
‚úÖ Added memory limit configuration
üü° Still recommend crossbeam_channel for better performance

New suggestion:
- Consider adding circuit breaker pattern for handling downstream failures
````

### 2025-08-30 15:00: [@claude] Performance optimization

Switched to crossbeam_channel as suggested

- 15% throughput improvement confirmed
- Files changed:
  - `Cargo.toml` - Added crossbeam-channel dependency
  - `src/indexer/parallel.rs` - Migrated from tokio channels

### 2025-08-30 16:30: [@galligan] Local benchmark results

```bash
# Benchmark results after optimizations
test indexing::parallel_small    ... bench:       2,341 ns/iter (+/- 123)
test indexing::parallel_large    ... bench:     892,456 ns/iter (+/- 15,234)
test indexing::sequential_small  ... bench:       8,234 ns/iter (+/- 423)
test indexing::sequential_large  ... bench:   3,123,456 ns/iter (+/- 89,123)
```

## Follow-up Work

- [ ] BLZ-44: Add circuit breaker pattern (suggested in review)
- [ ] BLZ-45: Add Prometheus metrics for monitoring
- [ ] BLZ-46: Document parallel indexing configuration in user guide
