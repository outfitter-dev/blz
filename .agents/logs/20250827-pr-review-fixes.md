4. **Prepare for v0.1 release** once all PRs are merged

## Technical Notes

### Platform-Specific Paths (Final Configuration)
After fixes, the correct paths are:

**Data Storage**:

- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/outfitter.blz/`
- Linux: `~/.local/share/outfitter/blz/`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\outfitter\blz\`

**Configuration**:

- macOS: `~/Library/Preferences/outfitter.blz/global.toml`
- Linux: `~/.config/outfitter/blz/global.toml`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\outfitter\blz\global.toml`

### Key Implementation Details

1. **Tilde Expansion Fix**: Changed from using raw `PathBuf::from("~/.outfitter/blz")` to properly using `directories::BaseDirs::new()` for home directory expansion.

2. **Update Command**: Fully functional with ETag/Last-Modified conditional fetching and archive support. Not a stub as previously documented.

3. **Diff Command**: Experimental and hidden via `#[arg(hide = true)]` in CLI. Documented as "coming soon" in all user-facing documentation.

4. **Shell Support**: Now includes bash, zsh, fish, elvish, and powershell completions.

## Session Context

This session was a continuation of previous work where the v0.1 features (issues #36, #34, #33) were completed. The focus was on addressing all review comments to prepare for merging and the v0.1 release.

The blz project is a local-first search tool for llms.txt documentation built with Rust and Tantivy, providing millisecond-latency search with exact line citations.
