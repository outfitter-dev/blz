# Senior Engineering Code Review: blz

## Review Agent Prompt

You are a senior software engineer with 15+ years of experience in systems programming, CLI tools, and developer productivity. You're also an AI coding agent who frequently needs to navigate documentation quickly and efficiently. Your review should be:

1. **Pedantic and thorough** - No detail is too small. Question every design decision.
2. **User-focused** - Think like both a human developer AND an AI agent who needs to process documentation
3. **Performance-obsessed** - This tool needs to be FAST. Sub-10ms is the baseline, not the goal.
4. **Feature-rich** - Suggest features that would make YOUR life easier as a coding agent
5. **Architecture-critical** - Question the fundamental design choices

Focus areas:
- Code quality, patterns, and Rust idioms
- Performance bottlenecks and optimization opportunities  
- CLI UX for both humans and agents
- Missing features that would accelerate documentation discovery
- Architecture decisions that limit extensibility

Be harsh but constructive. Every criticism should come with a suggested improvement.

## Executive Summary

*[Agent: Provide a 3-4 sentence overview of the codebase quality and your main concerns]*

## Architecture Review

### Core Design Decisions

*[Review the fundamental architecture choices: Tantivy for search, local-first approach, registry pattern, etc. Are these the right choices? What alternatives should have been considered?]*

### Module Organization

*[Review the workspace structure, module boundaries, and separation of concerns. Is the code well-organized? Are there better patterns?]*

### Data Flow

*[Trace the flow from CLI command to search results. Are there unnecessary layers? Bottlenecks? Better approaches?]*

## Code Quality Analysis

### Rust Idioms and Patterns

*[Review use of Rust patterns. Are they using the right abstractions? Any anti-patterns? Missing opportunities for zero-cost abstractions?]*

### Error Handling

*[Comprehensive review of error handling. Are errors informative? Is recovery possible? Better error types needed?]*

### Performance Critical Sections

```rust
// Example: Point out specific code that needs optimization
// Include line numbers and file paths
```

*[Identify hot paths that need optimization. Unnecessary allocations? Missing parallelism? Cache misses?]*

### Memory Management

*[Review memory usage patterns. Any leaks? Unnecessary clones? Better data structures?]*

## CLI User Experience

### Current Command Analysis

*[Review existing commands. Are they intuitive? Consistent? What's missing?]*

### Suggested New Commands

```bash
# Command suggestions with rationale
blz explain <term> --context <alias>  # AI-friendly explanation of a concept
blz diff <alias1> <alias2>            # Compare two versions of documentation  
blz watch <alias> --notify            # Watch for documentation updates
blz export --format markdown          # Export for processing
blz analyze --complexity              # Measure documentation complexity
blz graph --dependencies              # Show connection between concepts
```

### Agent-Specific Features

*[As an AI agent, what features would make this tool indispensable for you?]*

1. **Structured Output Modes**
   - JSON with semantic sections
   - AST-like representation of documentation structure
   - Relationship graphs between concepts

2. **Context Windows**
   - Smart chunking for LLM context limits

3. **Semantic Search**
   - Vector embeddings for similarity search
   - Concept clustering
   - Query expansion based on documentation structure

## Missing Features Priority List

### P0 - Critical (Blocks agent productivity)

1. **Incremental Updates**
   ```rust
   // Instead of full re-index, track changes
   pub struct IncrementalIndexer {
       change_tracker: ChangeLog,
       partial_index: PartialIndex,
   }
   ```

2. **Streaming Results**
   - Start returning results before search completes
   - Progressive refinement
   - Early termination when sufficient results found

3. **Query Intelligence**
   - Typo correction
   - Synonym expansion  
   - Context-aware suggestions

### P1 - Important (Significant productivity gain)

1. **Multi-format Support**
   - Markdown beyond llms.txt
   - Code documentation extraction
   - API spec parsing (OpenAPI, GraphQL)

2. **Cross-reference System**
   - Link related concepts
   - Build knowledge graph
   - Navigate documentation relationships

3. **Caching Strategy**
   - Multi-level cache (memory, disk, network)
   - Predictive pre-fetching
   - Smart eviction policies

### P2 - Nice to Have

*[List additional features with implementation sketches]*

## Performance Optimization Opportunities

### Immediate Wins

```rust
// Example: Current code
fn search(&self, query: &str) -> Vec<Result> {
    self.index.search(query).collect()  // Allocates unnecessarily
}

// Suggested improvement
fn search<'a>(&'a self, query: &str) -> impl Iterator<Item = Result> + 'a {
    self.index.search(query)  // Lazy evaluation
}
```

### Architectural Changes

1. **Parallel Search**
   - Search multiple indices concurrently
   - Use rayon for data parallelism
   - Async streaming results

2. **Index Optimization**
   - Custom tokenizer for technical documentation
   - Optimize for common query patterns
   - Reduce index size with better compression

3. **Startup Time**
   - Lazy index loading
   - Memory-mapped indices
   - Background initialization

## Security and Reliability

### Security Concerns

*[Review security implications. Input validation? Path traversal? Resource exhaustion?]*

### Reliability Issues

*[What could cause failures? How does it handle corruption? Network issues?]*

## Testing Gaps

### Missing Test Coverage

*[Identify untested code paths, edge cases, error conditions]*

### Test Quality Issues

*[Are tests actually testing the right things? Flaky tests? Too much mocking?]*

## Refactoring Recommendations

### High Priority Refactors

1. **Extract Search Pipeline**
   ```rust
   // Current: Monolithic search function
   // Suggested: Composable pipeline
   pub struct SearchPipeline {
       stages: Vec<Box<dyn PipelineStage>>,
   }
   ```

2. **Decouple Storage from Index**
   - Current: Tight coupling
   - Suggested: Storage trait with multiple implementations

### Technical Debt

*[List technical debt with remediation strategies]*

## Integration Opportunities

### LLM Integration

```rust
// Suggested: Built-in LLM enhancement
pub trait LLMEnhancer {
    async fn summarize(&self, results: &[SearchResult]) -> Summary;
    async fn explain(&self, concept: &str, context: &Context) -> Explanation;
    async fn suggest_related(&self, query: &str) -> Vec<String>;
}
```

1. *[Longer-term enhancements and architectural changes]*

## Code Snippets and Examples

### Example 1: Better Error Messages

```rust
// Current
Err(anyhow!("Search failed"))

// Suggested
Err(SearchError::QueryParseFailed {
    query: query.to_string(),
    position: error_pos,
    suggestion: did_you_mean(&query),
    context: "Failed to parse boolean operator. Use AND, OR, NOT",
})
```

### Example 2: Performance Optimization

```rust
// Current: Allocates for each search
pub fn search(&self, query: &str) -> Vec<SearchResult> {
    let mut results = Vec::new();
    // ... search logic
    results
}

// Suggested: Reuse allocation
pub struct Searcher {
    result_buffer: Vec<SearchResult>,
}

impl Searcher {
    pub fn search(&mut self, query: &str) -> &[SearchResult] {
        self.result_buffer.clear();
        // ... search logic reusing buffer
        &self.result_buffer
    }
}
```

### Example 3: CLI Enhancement

```rust
// Suggested: Rich CLI output with progress
use indicatif::{ProgressBar, ProgressStyle};

pub fn search_with_progress(sources: &[Source], query: &str) {
    let pb = ProgressBar::new(sources.len() as u64);
    pb.set_style(ProgressStyle::default_bar()
        .template("{spinner:.green} [{bar:40.cyan/blue}] {pos}/{len} {msg}")
        .progress_chars("#>-"));
    
    for source in sources {
        pb.set_message(format!("Searching {}", source.name));
        // ... search logic
        pb.inc(1);
    }
    pb.finish_with_message("Search complete");
}
```
