# Checkpoint - Agent Logs Cleanup and Branchwork Template Creation

## Summary

Performed comprehensive cleanup of agent logs, archiving old entries and creating a new BRANCHWORK template for tracking branch lifecycle from PR creation through merge. Fixed script bug and updated documentation to use template links rather than inline content.

## Tasks

### Done

- [x] Archived old agent logs (7 files from Aug 22-27) to `.agents/logs/.archive/`
- [x] Created comprehensive BRANCHWORK.md template with improved structure
- [x] Updated AGENTS.md to link to templates instead of inline content
- [x] Created CLAUDE.md as symlink to AGENTS.md (single source of truth)
- [x] Fixed bug in `new-log.sh` script (undefined DATE_SUFFIX variable)
- [x] Updated WORKLOGS.md with script documentation

### In Progress

- [ ] Branchwork script implementation (for CURRENT.md management)

### Not Started

- [ ] Auto-archive workflow for merged branches
- [ ] Script for appending updates to branchwork logs

## Changes

- `.agents/logs/.archive/` - Moved 7 old logs here
- `.agents/logs/templates/BRANCHWORK.md` - New template for branch lifecycle tracking
- `.agents/logs/AGENTS.md` - Updated with template links and script docs
- `.agents/logs/CLAUDE.md` - Now symlink to AGENTS.md
- `.agents/rules/WORKLOGS.md` - Added script documentation
- `.agents/scripts/new-log.sh` - Fixed DATE_SUFFIX bug (line 146)

## Decisions & Rationale

- **BRANCHWORK template structure**: Single chronological "Updates" section to avoid merge conflicts
- **Unicode branch visualization**: Tree-style characters (├─●, └─○) for clear stack representation
- **CLAUDE.md as symlink**: Maintains single source of truth, avoids sync issues
- **Archive threshold**: Kept only today's logs (Aug 29), archived all prior dates

## Current State

- **Branch Status**: Active development on branchwork documentation
- **CI Status**: N/A - documentation changes only
- **PR Stack**: Part of larger documentation reorganization effort
- **Open Items**: Need to implement branchwork.sh script for CURRENT.md management

## Blockers

None - script implementation can be done by other agent working in parallel

## Next Steps

1. Test the new-log.sh script with various template types
2. Document the branchwork lifecycle in more detail
3. Consider auto-detection of merged PRs for archiving

## Follow-ups

- Consider adding `gt log` integration to branchwork template for automatic stack updates
- Add validation to ensure CURRENT.md stays in sync with active branch
- Create cleanup script for orphaned branchwork files

## Context/Notes

The BRANCHWORK template provides a persistent document that follows a branch through its entire lifecycle. Key features:
- Visual branch stack representation
- Chronological updates section (avoids merge conflicts)
- Verbatim review comment preservation
- CI status tracking table
- Clear success criteria and merge checklist at top
