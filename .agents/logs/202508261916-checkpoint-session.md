# blz Development Handoff - 2025-08-26

## Session Summary

Successfully resolved dependency issues and cleaned up the PR queue, preparing the project for next phase of P0 work.

## What Was Accomplished

### Pull Request Resolution
- **Closed PR #29**: Use rustls instead of native-tls
  - Reason: Superseded by PR #35 which included the same changes
  - Had CI failures that were resolved in PR #35
  
- **Merged PR #35**: Remove unused pretty_assertions dependency
  - Fixed CI issue #30 (cargo shear failure)
  - Included rustls migration from PR #29
  - Added http2 feature to reqwest dependency
  - Added release planning documentation
  - Added Claude dispatch workflow
  - All CI checks passed

### Key Technical Changes
1. **Dependency cleanup**: Removed unused `pretty_assertions` from `blz-core/Cargo.toml`
2. **TLS migration**: Switched `reqwest` to use `rustls-tls` instead of `native-tls` for better cross-platform portability
3. **HTTP/2 support**: Added `http2` feature to reqwest dependency (required for `.http2_prior_knowledge()` calls)

## Current State

### Repository Status
- **Main branch**: Clean and up to date
- **Open PRs**: None ‚úÖ
- **CI Status**: All passing
- **Build warnings**: 4 warnings about unused code in blz-cli (non-critical)
  - `SourceInfoFormatter` never constructed
  - `ProgressDisplay` never constructed
  - Related unused associated functions

### Priority Work Queue (P0 Issues)

1. **Issue #31: Correct heading-block extraction** üêõ
   - **Type**: Bug fix
   - **Location**: `crates/blz-core/src/parser.rs`
   - **Problem**: Parser not extracting exact line slices for headings
   - **Impact**: Incorrect line number citations in search results
   - **Recommendation**: Start here - critical bug affecting core functionality

2. **Issue #36: Tighten lints & hide diff command** üîß
   - **Type**: Quality improvements
   - **Tasks**:
     - Hide experimental `diff` command from CLI help
     - Improve error messages
     - Tighten Clippy lints
   - **Impact**: Better UX and code quality

3. **Issue #32: Unify storage paths** üìÅ
   - **Type**: Breaking change
   - **Change**: Move to `~/.outfitter/blz/` from current scattered locations
   - **Needs**: Migration logic for existing installations
   - **Impact**: Foundation for other features

4. **Issue #33: Implement update command** üîÑ
   - **Type**: New feature
   - **Features**: ETag/Last-Modified support, archive old versions
   - **Dependency**: Works better after Issue #32

5. **Issue #34: Parallel multi-source search** ‚ö°
   - **Type**: Performance enhancement
   - **Impact**: Faster searches across multiple sources
   - **Implementation**: Use `FuturesUnordered` or similar

## Technical Context

### Key Files for Next Work

For Issue #31 (Parser fix):
- `crates/blz-core/src/parser.rs` - Main parser logic
- `crates/blz-core/src/index.rs` - How parser results are indexed
- `crates/blz-core/src/types.rs` - Data structures (Block, LineRange)

### Architecture Notes
- Using Tree-sitter for markdown parsing
- Tantivy for search indexing
- Strict Clippy lints (no unsafe code, no unwrap/expect)
- Performance target: <10ms search latency (currently achieving ~6ms)

### Testing Approach
- Tests exist but need expansion (Issues #27, #28)
- Run with: `cargo test --workspace`
- Benchmarks: `cargo bench` (limited coverage currently)

## Release Planning

Per `.agents/memory/docs/20250825-blz-release-stack-plan.md`, v0.1 release requires:
- ‚úÖ Search latency < 10ms (achieved)
- ‚ùå Accurate line citations (blocked by Issue #31)
- ‚ùå Stable storage format (blocked by Issue #32)
- ‚ùå Clean error messages (Issue #36)
- ‚ùå Hidden experimental features (Issue #36)

## Recommended Next Steps

### Immediate Priority
1. **Fix parser (Issue #31)**
   - Most critical bug
   - Well-scoped to parser module
   - No breaking changes
   - Directly impacts search accuracy

### Then Consider
2. **Quick quality wins (Issue #36)**
   - Multiple small improvements
   - Improves user experience
   - Can be done incrementally

### Before v0.1 Release
3. **Storage unification (Issue #32)**
   - Breaking change - better now than later
   - Enables proper update command
   - Needs careful migration strategy

## Environment Notes

- Rust toolchain: stable
- Main dependencies: tantivy 0.22, tree-sitter, tokio, reqwest
- Using lefthook for git hooks
- CI: GitHub Actions with cargo-deny, cargo-audit

## Handoff Complete

The project is in a clean state with no open PRs and clear priorities. The parser bug (Issue #31) is the recommended starting point for the next work session.

### Quick Start Commands
```bash
# Start work on parser fix
git checkout -b fix/parser-line-extraction
cargo test -p blz-core parser  # Run parser tests
cargo watch -x "test -p blz-core parser"  # Watch mode

# Key files to examine
cat crates/blz-core/src/parser.rs
cat crates/blz-core/src/types.rs | grep -A 20 "struct Block"
```

### Success Criteria for Issue #31
- Heading blocks contain exact line ranges from source
- No off-by-one errors in line numbers
- Tests verify correct extraction with multi-line headings
- Search results show accurate line citations
