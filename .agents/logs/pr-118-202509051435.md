## Summary
Fixed the concurrent search benchmark that was inadvertently changed from concurrent execution to sequential execution, restoring the benchmark's ability to properly measure concurrent performance.

## Review Comments Checklist

### Diamond Review Comment
- [x] **Performance Issue in concurrent_search benchmark**
  - Location: `crates/blz-core/benches/performance_optimizations.rs:407-413`
  - Issue: Changed from concurrent `search_multiple()` to sequential loop
  - Suggested Fix: Use `futures::future::join_all()` for proper concurrent execution
  - Priority: High - Benchmark accuracy
  - **Resolution**: Used `tokio::task::spawn_blocking` + `futures::future::join_all()` with `Arc<SearchIndex>` to restore true concurrent execution while working with synchronous API

## Resolution Tracking

### âœ… Completed
1. **Concurrent Benchmark Fix** (Diamond) - `0dbecd9`
   - Restored concurrent execution using `tokio::task::spawn_blocking`
   - Used `Arc<SearchIndex>` to safely share index across tasks
   - Applied `futures::future::join_all()` for proper concurrent coordination
   - Benchmark now accurately measures concurrent search performance

### Implementation Details
The fix addresses the core issue where the benchmark was changed from using an async `search_multiple()` method to a synchronous loop. Since the available `SearchIndex::search()` method is synchronous, the solution uses:

1. **`Arc<SearchIndex>`**: Share the search index safely across concurrent tasks
2. **`tokio::task::spawn_blocking`**: Run each synchronous search operation concurrently
3. **`futures::future::join_all()`**: Coordinate all concurrent tasks and collect results

This approach maintains the benchmark's original intent of measuring concurrent search performance while working within the constraints of the synchronous search API.
