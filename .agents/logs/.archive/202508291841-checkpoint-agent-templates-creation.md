# Checkpoint - Agent Documentation Templates Creation

## Summary

Created comprehensive template system for all agent log types, standardizing documentation format across checkpoint, recap, review, debug, refactor, feature, and migration logs.

## Tasks

### Done

- [x] Reorganize agent documentation structure
  - CLOSES: BLZ-23
  - Migrated from .agents to .agents
  - Standardized naming conventions
  - Updated all references (8 files)
- [x] Create checkpoint template with full example
  - Added all requested sections (Decisions, Blockers, Follow-ups)
  - Integrated issue tracking into tasks
  - Added inline comments for guidance
- [x] Create templates for all other log types
  - [x] RECAP.md - Daily summaries
  - [x] REVIEW.md - PR review tracking
  - [x] DEBUG.md - Debugging sessions
  - [x] REFACTOR.md - Major refactoring
  - [x] FEATURE.md - Feature implementation
  - [x] MIGRATION.md - Breaking changes
- [x] Add frontmatter comments to all templates

### In Progress

### Not Started

## Changes

- `.agents/logs/templates/CHECKPOINT.md`: Created comprehensive checkpoint template
- `.agents/logs/templates/RECAP.md`: Created daily recap template
- `.agents/logs/templates/REVIEW.md`: Created PR review template
- `.agents/logs/templates/DEBUG.md`: Created debug session template
- `.agents/logs/templates/REFACTOR.md`: Created refactoring template
- `.agents/logs/templates/FEATURE.md`: Created feature implementation template
- `.agents/logs/templates/MIGRATION.md`: Created migration template
- `.agents/docs/improving-agent-rust-dev.md`: Added Rust development guide
- `.agents/docs/blz-release-stack-plan.md`: Improved formatting
- `.markdownlint-cli2.jsonc`: Fixed JSON formatting

## Decisions & Rationale

- **Separate templates over single mega-template**: Each log type has unique needs, better to have focused templates
- **Examples section at bottom**: Keeps template clean while providing guidance when needed
- **Inline comments in frontmatter only**: Provides help without cluttering the main template
- **Slug field added**: Enables unique references and better organization
- **Changes section covers files**: Simpler than separate "Files Changed" section

## Current State

- **Branch Status**: 1 commit ahead of main, 3 uncommitted files
- **CI Status**: Not run (local changes)
- **PR Stack**: Single branch off main
- **Open Items**: Linear issue update pending

## Blockers

None - all templates created and ready for use.

## Next Steps

- Commit remaining changes (templates and documentation)
- Update Linear issue BLZ-23 with completion status
- Test templates with actual development work
- Consider adding a script to generate new logs from templates

## Follow-ups

- Add template selection to get-date.sh script
- Create VS Code snippets for quick template insertion
- Document template usage in .agents/README.md
- Consider automated archiving based on AGENTS.md rules

## Context/Notes

Templates were designed to be tight and focused based on analysis of existing logs. Each template includes a complete realistic example to guide usage. The checkpoint template evolved through several iterations to find the right balance between comprehensiveness and brevity. All templates follow consistent structure while allowing for type-specific sections.
