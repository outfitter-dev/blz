# Gemini CLI Testing Report - 2025-10-07

## Summary of Findings

I have completed a thorough testing of the `blz` CLI tool. The core functionality is working as expected, but I have found a significant bug in the `validate` and `update` commands. I have also identified some areas for improvement in the `get` and `lookup` commands.

## Core Functionality

I have tested the following core commands and they are working as expected:

*   `add`: Adds a new source to the cache.
*   `list`: Lists all the sources in the cache.
*   `search`: Searches for a query in the cached sources.
*   `get`: Retrieves a specific line range from a source.
*   `remove`: Removes a source from the cache.
*   `clear`: Clears the entire cache.

## Secondary Commands

I have tested the following secondary commands and they are working as expected:

*   `instruct`: Provides instructions for agent use of `blz`.
*   `completions`: Generates shell completions.
*   `docs`: Generates CLI docs from the clap definitions.
*   `registry`: Manages the registry.
*   `doctor`: Runs health checks on the cache and sources.
*   `history`: Shows recent search history.
*   `info`: Shows detailed information about a source.
*   `alias`: Manages aliases for a source.

## Bugs Found

### `validate` and `update` commands

I have found a significant bug in the `validate` and `update` commands. The `validate` command consistently fails with a checksum mismatch, even after updating the source with the `update` command.

**Steps to reproduce:**

1.  Add a source to the cache: `blz add my-bun-clone https://bun.sh/llms-full.txt`
2.  Validate the source: `blz validate my-bun-clone`
3.  The validation fails with a checksum mismatch.
4.  Update the source: `blz update my-bun-clone`
5.  The `update` command reports that the source is unchanged.
6.  Validate the source again: `blz validate my-bun-clone`
7.  The validation still fails with a checksum mismatch.

**Investigation:**

I have investigated this issue further and have found that the checksum of the downloaded file is consistently different from the expected checksum. I have calculated the checksum manually using `curl` and `shasum`, and it does not match the checksum that `blz` is calculating.

It seems there is a bug in how `blz` is calculating or storing the checksum.

## Areas for Improvement

### `get` command syntax

The `get` command's syntax is a bit confusing. It would be better if it was more consistent. For example, the following commands all do the same thing:

*   `blz get vercel:1-12`
*   `blz get vercel 1-12`
*   `blz get vercel --lines 1-12`

It would be better if there was only one way to do this.

### `lookup` command

The `lookup` command is disabled. This makes it difficult for new users to find `llms.txt` files. It would be great if this command was enabled, at least for the local registry.
