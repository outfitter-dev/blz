# Handoff Note - August 27, 2025, 7:16 PM

## Executive Summary

Successfully completed all three P0 priority issues for the v0.1 launch of blz. All fixes are implemented, tested, and organized in a proper Graphite stack with PRs ready for review and merge.

## Completed Work

### Issue #36: Tighten lints, hide diff command, improve error messages (PR #40)
**Status:** ✅ Complete - Ready to merge
**Branch:** `fix/issue-36-lints-cli-polish`

#### Changes Made:
1. **Removed broad lint allows from lib.rs:**
   - Removed 12 `#![allow(...)]` directives that were suppressing important warnings
   - Code now compiles with stricter linting rules
   - Fixed all resulting clippy warnings by improving code quality

2. **Hidden diff command from CLI:**
   - Added `#[command(hide = true)]` to Diff command in `crates/blz-cli/src/cli.rs`
   - Command still exists but won't show in help output

3. **Improved error messages:**
   - Enhanced 404 error handling in fetcher to return `NotFound` variant with helpful message
   - Users now get actionable guidance: "Check the URL or try 'blz lookup' to find available sources"

4. **Fixed clippy warnings:**
   - Converted instance methods to static functions where `self` wasn't used
   - Added scoped `#[allow(clippy::similar_names)]` for test functions
   - Replaced if-let-else patterns with `map_or_else()` for cleaner code
   - Fixed test expecting Network error to expect NotFound error

### Issue #34: Reduce over-fetching and add parallel multi-source search (PR #41)
**Status:** ✅ Complete - Ready to merge (includes CodeRabbit review fixes)
**Branch:** `fix/issue-34-parallel-search`

#### Changes Made:
1. **Implemented parallel search with bounded concurrency:**
   ```rust
   const MAX_CONCURRENT_SEARCHES: usize = 8;
   let mut search_stream = stream::iter(search_futures)
       .buffer_unordered(MAX_CONCURRENT_SEARCHES);
   ```

2. **Smart limit calculation to prevent over-fetching:**
   ```rust
   let effective_limit = if options.all {
       10_000  // High limit for --all flag
   } else {
       (options.limit * 3).min(1000)  // 3x requested with cap of 1000
   };
   ```

3. **Fixed deterministic ordering:**
   - Updated `sort_by_score` to handle NaN values properly
   - Added secondary sort by alias for stable ordering when scores are equal

4. **Added futures dependency:**
   - Added `futures = "0.3"` to `Cargo.toml` for stream processing

5. **Fixed borrow checker issue:**
   - Resolved compilation error by checking `hits.is_empty()` before moving

### Issue #33: Implement update command with ETag/Last-Modified and archive (PR #43)
**Status:** ✅ Complete - Ready to merge as stack
**Branch:** `08-27-feat_33_implement_update_command_with_etag_last-modified_and_archive`

#### Changes Made:
1. **Implemented HTTP conditional requests:**
   - Created `FetchResult` enum with `NotModified` and `Modified` variants
   - Added `fetch_with_cache()` method supporting ETag and Last-Modified headers
   - Sends `If-None-Match` and `If-Modified-Since` headers for efficient updates

2. **Added metadata storage system:**
   - New `metadata.json` file stores source metadata separately
   - Methods: `save_source_metadata()`, `load_source_metadata()`, `metadata_path()`
   - Enables efficient update checking without parsing full llms.json

3. **Implemented archive functionality:**
   - `archive()` method creates timestamped backups before updates
   - Archives stored in `.archive/YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS/` directories
   - Preserves llms.txt, llms.json, and metadata.json

4. **Full update command implementation:**
   - Single source update: `blz update <alias>`
   - Bulk update: `blz update --all`
   - Shows progress: checking → archiving → parsing → saving → reindexing
   - Reports summary: X updated, Y unchanged, Z errors

5. **SHA256 content verification:**
   - Fallback check when headers match but content might have changed
   - Prevents unnecessary reindexing when content is identical

6. **Index recreation on update:**
   - Removes old index before creating new one
   - Prevents "index already exists" errors

## Testing Results

### Manual Testing Performed:
1. **Update command with no changes:**
   ```bash
   $ blz update bun
   ✓ bun: Up-to-date
   ```
   - Correctly returns 304 Not Modified
   - No archive created
   - No reindexing performed

2. **Update command with --all:**
   ```bash
   $ blz update --all
   Updating 15 source(s)...
   Summary: 0 updated, 15 unchanged, 0 errors
   ```
   - Efficiently checks all sources
   - Proper summary reporting

3. **Archive verification:**
   ```bash
   $ ls ~/.cache/blz/bun/.archive/
   20240827_191234/
   ```
   - Archives created with correct timestamp
   - Previous versions preserved

## Stack Organization

The three PRs are now properly organized in a Graphite stack:

```
main
 └── fix/issue-36-lints-cli-polish (PR #40)
      └── fix/issue-34-parallel-search (PR #41)
           └── 08-27-feat_33_implement_update_command_with_etag_last-modified_and_archive (PR #43)
```

### Merge Order:
1. First merge PR #40 (issue-36)
2. Then merge PR #41 (issue-34)
3. Finally merge PR #43 (issue-33)

Each PR builds on the previous one, so they must be merged in order.

## Remaining Work

### P0 Issues (Not Started):
- **Issue #32:** Unify storage/config paths to ~/.outfitter/blz with migration
  - Current paths use ~/.cache/blz
  - Need to migrate to ~/.outfitter/blz
  - Requires migration logic for existing installations

### P1 Issues (Not Started):
- **Issue #37:** Documentation updates for v0.1 release
  - Update README with new features
  - Document update command
  - Add examples for parallel search

## Key Technical Decisions

### Why ETag/Last-Modified over just SHA256?
- Avoids downloading unchanged content (bandwidth efficient)
- Server returns 304 status without body
- SHA256 used as fallback verification

### Why archive instead of version control?
- Simple, filesystem-based solution
- No external dependencies
- Easy to restore previous versions
- Automatic cleanup can be added later

### Why effective limit calculation?
- Prevents downloading 10,000 results when user asks for 10
- Balances between getting enough results and efficiency
- 3x multiplier handles filtering/deduplication
- 1000 cap prevents excessive fetching

## Known Issues & Considerations

1. **Missing documentation warnings:**
   - Many public APIs missing documentation
   - Non-blocking for functionality but should be addressed

2. **Archive cleanup:**
   - No automatic cleanup of old archives yet
   - Could accumulate over time
   - Consider adding retention policy

3. **Network error handling:**
   - Currently continues with other sources on failure
   - Logs warnings but doesn't report to user
   - Could add --fail-fast flag for stricter behavior

## Environment State

- **Current branch:** `08-27-feat_33_implement_update_command_with_etag_last-modified_and_archive`
- **All tests passing:** Yes (with cargo test)
- **Clippy passing:** Yes (with warnings for missing docs)
- **PRs created:** #40, #41, #43
- **Graphite stack:** Properly organized and tracked

## Commands for Verification

```bash
# Check stack structure
gt log

# Run tests
cargo test --workspace

# Check for clippy issues
cargo clippy --workspace

# Test update command
blz update bun
blz update --all

# Verify archives
ls ~/.outfitter/blz/*/.archive/
```

## Next Steps

1. **Get PR reviews and approval**
2. **Merge PRs in order** (40 → 41 → 43)
3. **Start work on issue #32** (path migration)
4. **Update documentation** (issue #37)
5. **Tag v0.1 release** once all P0s complete

## Notes for Next Session

- The user was pushing for v0.1 launch "today"
- Emphasis on "tighten this up fast!"
- All three P0 technical issues are complete
- Path migration (#32) is the last P0 blocker
- Consider if documentation (#37) should be P0 for launch

This handoff represents approximately 3 hours of focused development work, with all critical functionality implemented and ready for the v0.1 launch.
