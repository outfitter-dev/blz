Quick notes and links to detailed work logs.

## 2025-10-02

- Kicked off CLI refactor/testing initiative to improve seams for automation and coverage.
  - Decision: break large command functions into testable helpers; abstract prompts/subprocess/fs.
  - Next: start with `blz clear` to prototype dependency injection pattern.
- Refactored `blz clear` into testable core (`execute_clear`) with injectable storage/prompt and
  added unit coverage; updated `.gitignore` to drop ad-hoc coverage artifacts.
- Completed `blz list` refactor with storage trait, pure rendering helpers, and unit tests covering
  text/json paths and empty states.
- Followed up with `blz remove` refactor (storage seam, confirmation hook, richer tests). Command
  now exercises delete paths without touching the filesystem in unit tests.
- Refactored `blz update`: introduced storage/indexer seams, separated pure `apply_update`, and
  added unit coverage for content persistence. CLI flow now orchestrates fetch/parse/index via the
  shared helpers.
- **Major Initiative**: Flavor Elimination & URL Intelligence for v1.0.0-beta.1
  - Comprehensive audit of all flavor-related code (335+ lines identified for removal)
  - Designed URL intelligence system to auto-prefer llms-full.txt when available
  - Planned content detection warnings for low-value "index" files
  - Designed upgrade detection for existing sources
  - See: [202510021153-feature-flavor-elimination-and-url-intelligence-v1-0.md](.agents/logs/202510021153-feature-flavor-elimination-and-url-intelligence-v1-0.md)

## 2025-10-01

- Cherry-picked heading count fixes and 404 filtering from old branch
  - Created `count_headings()` utility for accurate recursive counting
  - Parser now skips placeholder "404" pages
  - Baseline level normalization for docs that don't start at H1
- Consolidated work logs into single comprehensive document
  - See: [v0.5.0-release-work.md](.agents/logs/v0.5.0-release-work.md)
- Pushed `gt/v0.5-release` branch to remote (ready for PR when needed)
- Restored metadata alias propagation for update/add flows; resolver now consults metadata aliases (branch `gt/feat/cli/restore-metadata-alias-propagation`)
- Fixed registry `create_source` cloning so cargo check/tests/install succeed; local CLI reinstalled after `cargo install --path crates/blz-cli`
- Removed backwards compatibility code for v0.4.x format
  - Removed 141-line custom `LlmsJson` deserializer
  - Added detection for old cache format with helpful error message
  - Created `blz clear` command with `--force` flag
  - Clears entire cache directory when old format detected
  - Error guides users to run `blz clear --force` then re-add sources
- Release prep: resolved bench API drift, removed unused CLI HTTP helper, restored
  expected JSON outputs for `blz get`/`search`, and re-ran cargo fmt/clippy/test
  (all green on 2025-10-01)

## 2025-09-30

- Completed alias terminology refactoring (commit 303ac00)
  - Renamed `LlmsJson.alias` â†’ `LlmsJson.source`
  - Added `--aliases` flag to `blz add` command
  - Updated all CLI help text for clarity
  - 21 files modified, all 224 tests passing
- Implemented registry system features
  - Created `blz registry create-source` command
  - Added `blz add --dry-run` for source analysis
  - Seeded registry with 22 verified sources
  - Built registry infrastructure (TOML â†’ JSON)
- Implemented upgrade command for llms.txt â†’ llms-full.txt migration

## 2025-09-29
